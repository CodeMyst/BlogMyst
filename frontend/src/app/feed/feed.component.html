                Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an
                enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be
                broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle
                guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights
                had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non
                prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room
                of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first
                kiss. (Laughs, tears out a page of the book) Like that's ever
                gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush).

                Lines of fairy tale creatures are put in chains and are led into
                wagons by Duloc Guards. The Captain of the Duloc Guards sits at
                a table paying people for bringing the fairytale creatures in.
                Waiting in line is Donkey on a leash and his owner. Some of the
                others in line include Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in
                a cage, Geppetto who is carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer
                carrying the Three Little Pigs.

                Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.
                You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet
                you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (The pixie dust's
                effects begin to wear off) Uh-oh. (He drops out of the air and
                hits the ground with a thud.)

                Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was
                great back there? Man those guards! They thought they was all of
                that. Then you showed up and bam! They was trippin' over
                themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel
                good to see that.
