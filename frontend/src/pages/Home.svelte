                Once upon a <mark>time</mark> there was a lovely princess. But
                she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could
                only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a
                castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave
                knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but
                non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest
                room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's
                first kiss. (Laughs, tears out a page of the book) Like that's
                ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush).

                Lines of fairy tale creatures are put in chains and are led into
                wagons by Duloc Guards. The Captain of the Duloc Guards sits at
                a table paying people for bringing the fairytale creatures in.
                Waiting in line is Donkey on a leash and his owner. Some of the
                others in line include Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in
                a cage, Geppetto who is carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer
                carrying the Three Little Pigs.
